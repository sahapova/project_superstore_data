1) Sales and profits incresed progressively by year, exept a little sales decresing 2015. Profit in 2015 too even with a short decreasing of sales. 
2) The most profitable quarter all year round was Q4. To maximize even more profits, we must make sure to have enough stock and push our marketing and customer service to make the most out of the October â€” December festive period.
3) The most performing states - California, New York and Washington. We have to focus more on them. Our least profitable markets are Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. However count of customers in less profitable states is high level. We should consider about pricing policy in this states.
4) The 3 categories: Copiers, Accessories, Phones are the best in terms of profits. Furnitures are still making profits but do not convert well in overall. With low profits and low profit margins, we should start to see what more we can bring to the furniture department. The sales are there but they do not translate smoothly.
